Answer: (XΛYΛZ)V(XΛYΛ¬Z)V(XΛ¬YΛZ)V(¬XΛYΛZ)V(¬XΛ¬YΛ¬Z)
II.	Convert the following statements into a predicate. Write the meaning of all the predicates that you will use. (5 points each)
Example: Since you never know what tomorrow may bring then don’t lose hope.
Answer: Let know(x) = x knows what tomorrow may bring          lose hope(x) = x lose hope
          x ¬know(x)   ¬lose hope(x)
4.	Some girls like boys who they don’t interact with regularly.
 Let girls(x) = x girls like boys
    		Let int(x)    = x interact
   		 Let reg(x)   = x regularly
		x girls(x) Λ int(x) < reg(x)

5.	It is not true that some people succeed by cheating.
 Let human(x) = x people succeed
 Let cht(x)       = x cheating
 	 (x  human(x)cht(x)) = False

6.	All curious people learns a lot except those who don’t act.
Let diligent(x)      = x curious people
  	  Let knowledge(x) = x learns a lot
   	 Let lazy(x)            = x those who don’t act
          knowledge(x) = x diligent(x) > lazy(x)

7.	If you want to do and can do something, then you do it. If you want to do but can’t do something, then learn it. (Note: two statements separated by a period like this one can be thought as a conjunction of two sentences.)
    Let yearn(x) = x want to do
    Let work(x)  = x can do something
    Let done(x)  = x do it
    Let study(x) = x learn it
          ((x yearn(x) Λ work(x))x done(x)) Λ ((x yearn(x) Λ ¬work(x))study(x))

8.	You have to be over 18 years old so that you can legally drink alcohol.
Let age(x)        = x18yrs old
Let omaiwa(x) = x you
Let drunk(x)    = x can legally drink alcohol
(omaiwa(x)age(x))x drunk(x)

9.	All should work hard as long as they are alive, and rest when they are dead.
Let work(x)    = x should work hard
Let life(x)       = x alive
 Let stop(x)     = x rest
Let corpse(x) = x dead
(x alive(x)x work(x)) Λ (x corpse(x)stop(x))

10.	Some people love shoes of certain kind. Some people love afternoons or the way the moon shines. (Note: two statements separated by a period like this one can be thought as a conjunction of two sentences.)
 Let lover(x) = x people love
  Let shoe(a)  = a shoes
  Let noon(x)  = x afternoons
  Let moon(x) = x the way the moon shines
          (x lover(x) Λ  a  shoe(a)) Λ (x lover(x) Λ noon(x) V moon(x))
